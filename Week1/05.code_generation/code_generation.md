### Run code_generation.py

### Postgres SQL tables, with their properties:
#
# Employee(id, name, department_id)
# Department(id, name, address)
# Salary_Payments(id, employee_id, amount, date)
#
### A query to list the names of the departments which employed more than 10 employees in the last 3 months
```
	query:
```sql
SELECT d.name
FROM Department d
JOIN Employee e ON d.id = e.department_id
JOIN Salary_Payments sp ON e.id = sp.employee_id
WHERE sp.date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months'
GROUP BY d.id, d.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) > 10
```

### Run code_generation_2.py
```
(azure) C:\project\Week1\05.code_generation>python code_generation_2.py
The given SQL query retrieves the names of departments that have more than 10 employees who have received salary payments in the last 3 months.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **FROM Department d JOIN Employee e ON d.id = e.department_id**
   This joins the `Department` table with the `Employee` table, linking each employee to their respective department.

2. **WHERE e.id IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Salary_Payments WHERE date > now() - interval '3 months')**
   This filters the employees to only those who have salary payment records within the last 3 months.

3. **GROUP BY d.name**
   The results are grouped by department name.

4. **HAVING COUNT(*) > 10**
   Only departments with more than 10 such employees are included in the final result.

**In summary:**
The query lists department names where more than 10 employees have been paid salaries in the past 3 months.
